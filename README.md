## What Is the Instant Karma Code?

## About the Creator

The creator of the Instant Karma Code bases the program on the ancient Sanskrit understanding of karma, which states that "the energy of our thoughts becomes our reality." Drawing inspiration from the neurological insights of Dr. Perry’s book ‘What Happened to You?’, this program is designed to help users break free from past traumas and reprogram their minds for success. While the author remains somewhat mysterious, the depth of knowledge and the scientific approach to karma suggest a profound understanding of both spirituality and psychology.

## How Does It Work?

The Instant Karma Code operates on the principles of neurology and karmic energy. It utilizes alpha brain waves embedded in subliminal guided meditation audio tracks to bypass negative subconscious beliefs and replace them with empowering thoughts. The program suggests that our past experiences shape what we believe we deserve, unknowingly blocking us from opportunities. By listening to these tracks, you can reprogram your subconscious, remove energetic blocks, and attract financial, emotional, and spiritual abundance.

The program debunks the idea that karma is an inescapable force of fate. Instead, it teaches you how to take control of your karmic energy and create the life you truly deserve. The secret lies in using three powerful audio tracks that act as a switch to transform your karma in the past, present, and future.

## What’s Inside the Instant Karma Code?

The program includes three powerful audio tracks, each designed to target a specific area of your karmic energy:

- **Track 1: Energizing Past Karma**

This track helps erase deeply ingrained negative beliefs and past traumas that may be holding you back. By using subliminal frequencies and guided meditation, it rewires your brain to accept self-worth, abundance, love, health, success, and spiritual growth. This track is crucial for breaking free from the past and welcoming a brighter future.

- **Track 2: Energizing Future Karma**

This second track reprograms your subconscious to recognize your deservedness of wealth, success, and happiness. It functions as a mental switch that activates a future full of abundance. By consistently listening to this track, you align your energy with your desires, magnetizing success into your life effortlessly.

- **Track 3: Energizing Present Karma**

The final track helps you stay present and fully embrace the power of karma in the now. Most people are stuck either dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, missing out on the present moment’s power. This track ensures you remain grounded, positive, and open to receiving prosperity.
